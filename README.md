# Covid-19 Analysis and Visualization using Plotly Express

This project provides **interactive visualizations** and analysis of **Covid-19 data** using **Plotly Express** and **Pandas**. It helps users explore the spread of Covid-19 across countries, analyze trends over time, and visualize key metrics such as total cases, deaths, and testing rates.

## 📊 Features
- **Interactive bar charts, scatter plots, and choropleth maps** for Covid-19 data analysis.
- **Comparisons of total cases, deaths, and recoveries** across different countries and continents.
- **Time-series analysis** of confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries.
- **Choropleth maps** for geographical Covid-19 spread visualization.
- **Word Cloud Generation** for analyzing Covid-19-related health conditions.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Python**
- **Plotly Express** (for interactive visualizations)
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **Matplotlib** (for additional plots)
- **Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab** (for execution)
- **WordCloud** (for textual data representation)

1️⃣ Install Dependencies:
pip install pandas plotly matplotlib wordcloud

2️⃣ Run the Notebook in Google Colab:
Upload your notebook to Google Colab and ensure the dataset files (covid.csv, covid_grouped.csv, coviddeath.csv) are available in the working directory


📈 Usage
* Load the dataset from CSV files.
* Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to check dataset structure and statistics.
* Generate visualizations:
* Bar charts for total cases, deaths, and tests per country.
* Scatter plots for continent-wise Covid-19 spread.
* Choropleth maps to visualize cases and deaths globally.
* Word cloud to analyze health conditions associated with Covid-19.
* Modify parameters to customize the analysis.
